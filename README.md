# Mobile-Reservation
An app that allows clients to reserve the products that they are going to buy in that market (like when you make a booking for a flight or a restaurant).

The Idea is that some person do not have enough time for going to buy things for daily use, and a first solution is to buy online, but somewhere those things are more expensive due to the cost of the shipping. But if you, going or coming from office pass near a market, why don't reserve a product and pass in the market only for take that an pay, of course with no queue!

I'm going to develop this app in Java (the client for the market) and hopefully I'm going to develop also the app for Android and iOS. 

The project will start soon.
